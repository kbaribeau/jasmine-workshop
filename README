This is code that I used to get some developers/testers working with jasmine at a client of Pillar's.

It uses the "Closest To Zero" problem, which is....
	1. Given a list of Integers (they can be positive or negative), find the one that is closest to zero.
	2. In the case where there are two integers that are equidistant to zero (for example, 1 and -1), prefer the positive result.
	3. If the input is empty do nothing.

I give the participants in this workshop four files:

	1. ClosestToZero.js, which contains the necessary code to highlight all results (ie: this is incorrect, but gets them started)
	2. ClosestToZeroSpec.js, which contains one jasmine spec that executes green
  3. An html SpecRunner for jasmine tests.
	4. closestToZero.html, which is a way to visibly see your progress.
